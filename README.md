# XML Extractor: Easily Retrieve XML from AI Responses

We've all experienced it—asking AI for neatly structured data, only to be confronted by a clutter of half-formed code blocks, haphazard XML tags scattered throughout, and general format confusion. The solution? **XML Extractor**, a slim, intuitive tool specifically designed to cut through the chaos and instantly capture XML from AI responses, making your workflow smooth and hassle-free.

## What's XML Extractor All About?

As powerful and useful as AI models can be, their formatting often feels unpredictable: at times producing perfect XML within tidy code fences, other times casually dropping unstructured tags into their output. XML Extractor gracefully manages this formatting uncertainty by:

- Extracting XML from code blocks, even when they're imperfectly formatted.
- Capturing standalone XML snippets scattered throughout text.
- Transforming extracted XML into clean, usable JavaScript objects.

No unnecessary complexity—just clear, accessible XML.

## How Do I Get Started?

Getting going is effortless. Begin by running this simple command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install xml-extractor
```

Here's a quick example to get you up and running:

```typescript
import { extractXMLObjects } from 'xml-extractor';

const aiResponse = `
Here’s some XML for you:
\`\`\`xml
<person><name>John</name></person>
\`\`\`
Oh, and check this out: <book><title>1984</title></book>
`;

try {
  const xmlObjects = await extractXMLObjects(aiResponse);
  console.log(xmlObjects);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Whoops:', error.message);
}
```

The result is clean and immediately usable:

```json
[{ "person": { "name": "John" } }, { "book": { "title": "1984" } }]
```

Easy, isn't it?

## A Quick Word from Me

I'm Seva, creator of XML Extractor. I built this tool because I personally grew weary of wresting clean XML from AI-generated content. It has vastly improved my own workflow, and I hope it brings value to you too. Enjoy your XML extracting!
